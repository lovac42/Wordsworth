# Wordsworth: Word Frequency Ranker

## About:
No wordlist is included in this addon. It is intended to work with any language and you will need to supply your own list which can be found on the internet in various formats.

The idea is to rank these words from most frequent to least. Depending on your needs, you would study the most frequent one's first, or separate them into multiple decks and use large interval modifiers to skim over the easy ones.


## Word lists:

### Line Count Word List (English):
Must rename ```.txt``` to ```.line```  
Unfortunely, this list seems to have alot of issue.

### Frequency Count Word List (English):
File extension must end with ```.txt```  

This word list has 50k words, mostly from english subtitled movies. It might be good for ESL students, but highly inaccurate for advanced english.
