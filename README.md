## About:
The idea is to rank these words from most frequent to least. Depending on your needs, you would study the most frequent one's first, or separate them into multiple decks and use large interval modifiers to skim over the easy ones. In addition, it can be used to seed MorphMan.

This addon is intended to work with any language and you will need to supply your own list which can be found on the internet in various formats. No actual wordlist is included, a sample list of 500 english words are included in the ```user_files``` folder for testing.
